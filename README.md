ðŸ‘‹ Hey there,
I'm happy to share with you my version of how the "1337 FELLOWSHIP App" might look like.
In case of any questions ðŸ’¬ please feel free to reach me using telegram @mouxez or by email mouxez@gmail.com

# Getting Started with the App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App TypeScript.
Besides React and TypeScript, I decided to use Ant Design as a main UI library, Axios for requests and some tools for code styling (Eslint, Prettier).

The project has Heroku pipeline which triggers on push to master branch and deploys the project [https://app-1337.herokuapp.com](https://app-1337.herokuapp.com).

To run the App:
 in the project directory you have to create you own .env file and set the REACT_APP_API_KEY variable. 
### `npm i && npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
